  abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic
	model for collections of
	
	discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical
	Bayesian model, in which each
	
	item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying
	set of topics. Each topic is, in
	
	turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic
	probabilities. In the context of
	
	text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation
	of a document. We present
	
	efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods
	and an EM algorithm for
	
	empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document
	modeling, text classification,
	
	and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model
	and the probabilistic LSI
	
	model.},

  abstract = {Recently, with the fast development of interactive information sharing
	on the internet, the query-oriented answer search services are more
	and more popular, such as Yahoo Answers, Google Answers and so on.
	Their common advantages are high precision, domain-specific search,
	clear format, etc. However towards domain-specific search, people
	usually are unable to determine suitable concept terms as queries
	to submit on account of their lack of domain knowledge. In this paper,
	we propose an approach for constructing a domain-specific answer
	ontology automatically in respect of Chinese queries to solve the
	said problem. First, queries and their answers are collected from
	a web search space. Second, for extracting implicated concept terms
	from collected queries and answers, the CKIP system is utilized to
	make a Chinese part-of-speech tagging procedure to segment. Thirdly,
	use a similarity measure to converge duplicate queries with their

  title = {Production Matching for Large Learning Systems},

  year = {1995},
  abstract = {One of the central results of AI research in the 1970's was that to
	achieve good performance,
	
	AI systems must have large amounts of knowledge. Machine learning
	techniques have been
	
	developed to automatically acquire knowledge, often in the form of
	if-then rules (productions).
	
	Unfortunately, this often leads to a utility problem | the \learning"
	ends up causing an overall
	
	slowdown in the system. This is because the more rules a system has,
	the longer it takes to
	
	match them against the current situation in order to determine which
	ones are applicable.
	
	To address this problem, this thesis is aimed at enabling the scaling
	up of the number of rules
	
	in production systems. We examine a diverse set of testbed systems,
	each of which learns
	
	at least 100,000 rules. We show that with the best existing match
	algorithms, the match
	
	cost increases linearly in the number of rules in these systems. This
	is inadequate for large
	
	learning systems, because it leads to a utility problem. We then examine
	the causes of this
	
	linear increase, and develop techniques which eliminate the major
	causes. The end result is an
	
	improved match algorithm, Rete/UL, which is a general extension of
	the existing state-of-theart Rete match algorithm. Rete/UL's performance
	scales well on a signicantly broader class
	
	of systems than existing match algorithms. The use of Rete/UL rather
	than Rete signicantly
	
	reduces or eliminates the utility problem in all the testbed systems.},
